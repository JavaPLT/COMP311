 command on its Clear cluster for uploading a program submission to the
repository.&nbsp; The command was supported by a web interface so that
you could perform the same operation remotely. This command is now
available only on machines in the CLEAR cluster.&nbsp; The web interface
 no longer exists.&nbsp; For this reason, we strongly recommend that you
 use regular SVN commands to submit assignments from your personal
machines to the Rice SVN repository.&nbsp; Hence, you will need to learn
 how to use an SVN client to directly interact with the repository,
which is not difficult.&nbsp; If you prefer using Git, you can also try
using <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-and-Subversion">the Subversion client built into Git (git svn)</a>.&nbsp; The old t<em>urnin</em>&nbsp;command
 simply committed the contents of a directory (corresponding to a
particular assignment) specified by an argument to the command.&nbsp;
When you develop a program using the same directory structure (which we
will stipulate),<em> all</em>&nbsp;of your commits to that directory are
 effectively submissions of your program.&nbsp; Of course, they aren't
bona fide solutions until you finish your assignment.&nbsp; We will not
inspect them until after the assignment is due.</p><p>Note: if you need to use a slip day, please send an email message to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:comp311@rice.edu">comp311@rice.edu</a>&nbsp;stating that fact before the assignment is due, so we know not to grade your program prematurely.</p><h1>Option A: Using SVN commands to access Rice SVN from personal machines</h1><h2>Submitting your Homework from your Linux or Mac machine (Using SVN commands)</h2><ol><li><p>&nbsp;One time setup on your machine</p><ol><li>Make a new empty directory&nbsp;comp311&nbsp;in your home directory and switch to that directory:<br>mkdir comp311&nbsp;<br>cd comp311<br><br></li><li>Use Subversion to check out your submission directory:<br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">svn checkout&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><a href="https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/">https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/</a><em>F20</em>/</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">«your-net-id»</span><br></em></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">E.g., for Fall 2020 and the NetID&nbsp; "xyz99":&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><em><br><strong><a href="https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/F17/xyz99">https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/<em>F20</em>/<em>xyz99</em></a></strong></em></span></strong><br><br></li></ol></li><li>To check the status of your current directory, run :<br><strong>svn status</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><br>This should show all your files that are added(A) / not added(?) / deleted(D) / modified (M) to the Subversion repository.<br><br></li><li>To add folders/ files, use :&nbsp;<br><strong>svn add&nbsp;</strong>«<strong>file_name</strong>» (without angle brackets)<br><strong>svn add&nbsp;</strong>«<strong>folder_name</strong>» (without angle brackets)&nbsp;– recursively adds all files in it<br>This should show all files/ folders that have been added to the Repository (this is still a local copy)<ol><li>To delete folders/ files, use :&nbsp;<br><strong>svn del&nbsp;</strong>«<strong>file_name</strong>» (without angle brackets)<br><strong>svn del&nbsp;</strong>«<strong>folder_name</strong>» (without angle brackets)&nbsp;– recursively adds all files in it<br>This should show all files/ folders that have been deleted to the Repository (this is still a local copy)<br><br></li></ol></li><li>To commit your files, use:&nbsp;<br><strong>svn ci -m "Some relevant message here"</strong><br>This should show all the files that have been added/ modified/ deleted ... followed by<br>-- Transmitting file data.<br>-- Committed revision «rev. no»<br><br></li><li>And
 you have successfully added your folder/ files to the SVN repository.
Visit svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/&lt;netID&gt; in your browser to
confirm that all of your files (typically only one per HW assignment)
are intact.</li></ol><h2>Submitting your homework from your Windows machine</h2><p>If you are using Windows 10, the course staff recommends that you either:</p><ol><li>S<a href="http://wsl-guide.org/en/latest/">et up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>&nbsp;and then follow the steps above for using the SVN command on Linux, or&nbsp;</li><li>Use a standalone visual SVN client like <a href="https://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>,
 which augments the menus embedded Windows File Explorer with SVN
commands akin to those supported in Linux using the command
line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I am following the second approach which
is working well.&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; I also have WSL
installed on my Windows 10 laptop but I strongly prefer running the
native Windows 10 edition of Racket on my machine than the Linux edition
 of Racket inside WSL.&nbsp; If you install WSL, there are two choices:</p><ul><li>WSL
 1.0, the original version which embeds the Linux file system inside the
 Windows 10 file system and implements the Linux kernel as a Windows 10
application built on top of Windows services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>WSL 2.0, a new implementation based on OS virtualization (as done by VMWare and VirtualBox).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In
 my experience, WSL 2.0 works better than WSL 1.0.&nbsp; Both are
available for download from Microsoft (who developed them) and there are
 detailed instructions on the web on how to install either system.&nbsp;
 Regardless of whether you choose WSL 1.0 or WSL 2.0, you can select the
 particular variety of Linux that you want to install.&nbsp; I strongly
recommend installing the latest version of the long-term release of
Ubuntu (20.04).&nbsp; I have WSL 2.0 Unbuntu 20.04 installed on my
laptop.&nbsp; The principal problem with WSL 1.0 is that the final name
space in Windows is much more restrictive that it is in Linux and many
apps that you try to install on WSL 1.0 blow up because they use illegal
 fie names.&nbsp; The principal hassle with both WSL 1.0 and 2.0 is that
 GUI applications are painful to set up because they require some
control over the windowing system on Windows 10.&nbsp; The hack that I
use (again consult the web for various ways to solve the GUI
issue)&nbsp; requires eliminating firewall protection for the base
Windows 10 system, which I dislike.&nbsp; In contrast, the conventional
command line interface simply relies on Windows 10 terminal applications
 for program interaction, so security on your laptop is not
compromised.&nbsp; Microsoft is feverishly working on providing better
support for GUI applications in WSL 2.0 so I expect a much better
solution to this problem within a year.&nbsp; For now, WSL 2.0 is an
interesting curiosity and works well for Linux apps without a GUI
interface, but how many modern apps do not have a GUI?</p><p>Note: in
the latter part of the course when programming in Java, you may want to
use SVN integration supported by your IDE if it is available.&nbsp;
DrJava does not support IDE integration, but IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse
do.</p><h1>Option B: Using the Rice SVN Repository from machines in the CLEAR cluster</h1><h2>One time Setup in Clear</h2><ol><li>Login to CLEAR:<br><strong>ssh&nbsp;<em>&lt;your netid&gt;</em>@ssh.clear.rice.edu</strong><br><em><strong>&lt;your password&gt;<br></strong></em><em><strong><br></strong></em></li><li>Make a new empty directory&nbsp;<strong>comp311</strong>&nbsp;in your home directory and switch to that directory:<br><strong>mkdir comp311&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>cd comp311<br>&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Use Subversion to check out your submission directory:<br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">svn checkout&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/<em>«current-semester»</em>/</span><em><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">«your-net-id»</span><br></em></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">E.g., for Fall 2017 and the NetID&nbsp; "xyz99":</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><em><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><a href="https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/F17/xyz99"><span>https://svn.rice.edu/r/comp311/turnin/</span><em>F17</em>/<em>xyz99</em></a></span></strong></em></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><strong><em><br></em></strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"><em><br></em></span></strong></li><li>You might be asked if you wish to store your password unencrypted.
