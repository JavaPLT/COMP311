In Fall 2020, the official course website was at [link](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/FPSCALA/2020-Fall).

In Fall 2021, we will eventually move over the resources to GitHub Pages. This is a work in progress...

## Brief Description

This class provides an introduction to functional programming. Functional programming is a style of programming in which computations are solely expressed in terms of applications of functions to arguments (which themselves can be functions). This style of programming has a long history in computer science, beginning with the formulation of the Lambda Calculus as a foundation for mathematics. It has become increasingly popular in recent years because it offers important advantages in designing, maintaining, and reasoning about programs in modern contexts such as web services, parallel (multicore) programming, and distributed computing. Course work consists of a series of programming assignments in the Racket, Java, and Haskell programming languages plus occasional written homework assignments on underlying theory.
